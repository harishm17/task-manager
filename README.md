## Overview

**DivvyDo** is a production-ready expense management app designed for roommates and shared households. No more awkward conversations about who owes what—track expenses, split bills using 5 different methods, and settle balances with confidence.

### The Problem
- Manual expense tracking in spreadsheets is error-prone
- Calculating fair splits across multiple people is tedious
- Tracking who owes whom becomes messy with multiple transactions
- Existing apps are overcomplicated or charge fees

### The Solution
DivvyDo provides:
- **5 split methods** for any scenario (equal, exact, percentage, shares, adjustment)
- **Penny-perfect rounding** ensuring cents never disappear or duplicate
- **Automatic balance calculation** showing net and pairwise balances
- **Receipt uploads** with Supabase Storage integration
- **Admin tooling** for managing household members and exporting data

## Features

### Expense Management

**5 Split Methods** — Handle any splitting scenario:
1. **Equal**: Split evenly among N people (e.g., $100 ÷ 4 = $25 each)
2. **Exact**: Specify exact amounts per person (e.g., Alice $30, Bob $70)
3. **Percentage**: Split by percentages (e.g., Alice 60%, Bob 40%)
4. **Shares**: Weight-based splitting (e.g., Alice 2 shares, Bob 1 share)
5. **Adjustment**: Fixed adjustments on top of equal split (e.g., +$5 for Alice, -$5 for Bob)

**Penny-Perfect Rounding**:
- Ensures total split amounts always equal the original expense
- Distributes rounding errors fairly (largest-remainder method)
- Example: $100 split 3 ways → $33.34, $33.33, $33.33 (not $33.33 × 3 = $99.99)

**Receipt Uploads**:
- Upload photos via Supabase Storage
- Public bucket with row-level security
- Automatic file validation and size limits

**Recurring Templates**:
- Save frequently used expenses (rent, utilities, subscriptions)
- Manual generation (automated cron coming soon)

### Balance Tracking

**Net Balances**:
- See who owes money overall vs. who is owed
- Visual indicators (red for owes, green for owed)

**Pairwise Balances**:
- Detailed breakdown of who owes whom
- Example: "Alice owes Bob $45.67"

**Settlement Recording**:
- Mark balances as settled when paid
- Keeps audit trail of all transactions

### Household Management

**Groups**:
- Personal group for individual expenses
- Household groups for shared expenses
- Quick group switcher
- Rename, leave, or delete groups (admin only)

**Invite System**:
- Generate invite codes with expiration
- Email-based placeholder creation
- Automatic placeholder claim on signup

**Admin Tools**:
- **CSV Exports**: Download all expenses with full details
- **Merge People**: Combine duplicate entries with audit logs
- **Placeholder Management**: Convert email placeholders to real users

### Task Management

**Basic Task Tracking**:
- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Assign to household members
- Set status (todo, in progress, done) and priority
- Filters and search
- Recurring task templates

## Architecture

### Tech Stack

**Frontend**:
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- React Router for navigation
- Vitest + React Testing Library for testing

**Backend**:
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + Edge Functions)
- Row-Level Security for data protection
- Edge Functions for server-side logic

**Testing**:
- 25 test files covering:
  - Financial calculation logic
  - Balance computation
  - Component rendering
  - Split method accuracy

```

### Split Method Implementation

All split calculations are in `/src/utils/splitCalculations.ts`:

```typescript
export function calculateSplit(
  amount: number,
  method: SplitMethod,
  participants: Participant[]
): SplitResult[] {
  // Returns array of {userId, amount} ensuring sum equals original amount
}
```

**Rounding Algorithm** (Largest Remainder Method):
1. Calculate ideal amounts (may have fractions)
2. Round down all amounts to nearest cent
3. Calculate total shortage
4. Distribute shortage (1 cent each) to participants with largest remainders

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/harishm17/task-manager.git
cd task-manager

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Database Setup

2. Apply migrations:

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref

# Apply migrations
supabase db push
```

3. Create storage bucket:

      { userId: '2', amount: 33.33 },
      { userId: '3', amount: 33.33 }
    ]);

    // Verify total equals original amount
    const total = result.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.amount, 0);
    expect(total).toBe(100);
  });
});
